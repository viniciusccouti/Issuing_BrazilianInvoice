# Issuing_BrazilianInvoice
This project was an exercise to training some elements of selenium such as find elements by xpath,class and name.
The main goal is to open the hmtl page named login and once you enter there you must fill information about a service that supposedly happened.
After fill these information you must issue an invoice by clicking on the button at the bottom of the page.

You should repeat this process for all clients in the attached file "NotasEmitir.xlsx" which emulates a page from clients and its information.

Disclaimer: login and password in this page are not connected to a database. They are being used only with the purpose to simulate a login page.
